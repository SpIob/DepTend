# deptend.dev

**deptend.dev** converts a GitHub repository's dependency data into a prioritized, explainable list of maintenance missions. Instead of a flat vulnerability feed, it tells you what to fix next — combining security impact, ecosystem value, and estimated effort into a single ranked list, with every score's inputs one click away.

**Live dashboard:** [deptend.vercel.app](https://deptend.vercel.app)

---

## Why this exists

Open-source maintainers are often overwhelmed by a flood of alerts, dependency updates, and issues, with no clear path on what to prioritize. deptend.dev cuts through the noise with a maintenance-first, not vulnerability-first, view — the same underlying data, but ranked by what's actually worth doing next.

Three constraints are non-negotiable and shape every decision in this project:

- **Zero budget.** Every tool, service, and dependency is free at the tier this project actually uses.
- **Solo developer.** Architecture and workflow stay manageable by one person.
- **Transparency-first.** No black-box scoring. Every mission shows its formula, its inputs, and its confidence level — never a bare number.

## Two ways to use it

**The hosted dashboard** — visit [deptend.vercel.app](https://deptend.vercel.app), no account needed to browse missions. GitHub sign-in is only required to submit a new repo (capped at 3 indexed repos for the MVP).

**The CLI** — runs the same scoring engine against a local repo path, entirely in-memory, no account or hosted infrastructure required:

```bash
npx deptend <repo-path> --github-url <url> [--output <file>] [--json]
```

```bash
# Example
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<a token with public repo read access>  # recommended, raises GitHub's rate limit
npx deptend . --github-url https://github.com/your-username/your-repo --output missions.json
```

| Flag                 | Required         | Purpose                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<repo-path>`        | Yes (positional) | Local path to the repo root, i.e. the directory containing `package.json`                                                      |
| `--github-url <url>` | Yes              | The repo's GitHub URL — used to fetch stars/open-issues for ecosystem-value scoring. A local checkout alone can't derive this. |
| `--output <file>`    | No               | Write the full JSON result to this file                                                                                        |
| `--json`             | No               | Print the full JSON result to stdout instead of the human-readable summary (ignored if `--output` is set)                      |

**`GITHUB_TOKEN`** (env var, optional but recommended) raises the GitHub API rate limit from 60 to 5,000 requests/hour. A fine-grained PAT with public-repo read access is sufficient.

The CLI reuses the exact same scoring and ranking code the dashboard runs — same formula, same tie-break rules, same explainability. It doesn't touch a database and doesn't require the dashboard to be running; the two are independent, cross-verified implementations of the same engine, not a client/server pair.

**Note on npx:** `@deptend/cli`'s `bin` entry is set up for `npx`-style invocation once published, but hasn't been published to the npm registry yet as of Phase 4. Until then, run it from a local clone — see [Local development](#local-development) below, or use `pnpm --filter @deptend/cli exec deptend <args>` / `node cli/dist/index.js <args>` from the repo root after building.

## What a mission looks like

Every mission — on the dashboard or from the CLI — includes:

- **What's affected** — the package, its declared version range, and whether it's a production or development dependency
- **The advisory** — source (OSV/GHSA), severity, CVSS score if available, a link to the original record, and the version that fixes it
- **The recommended action** — a plain-language upgrade instruction
- **The score and every input that produced it** — never a bare number
- **Confidence** — visibly flagged when data is incomplete (no lock file parsed yet, no CVSS score available, no downstream-dependents data, etc.), never hidden

## How scoring works

```
composite_score = impact_score × 0.60 + ecosystem_value_score × 0.40
```

- **Impact** — CVSS score if available, otherwise a severity-based estimate, discounted for development dependencies (they don't ship to end users) and for transitive dependencies.
- **Ecosystem value** — log-scaled repo stars, open issues, and (once available) downstream dependents.
- **Effort** — semver bump size required to reach the fixed version (patch/minor/major → trivial/low/.../high), refined by migration-guide data once that's ingested.

Missions are ranked by `composite_score`, bucketed into fixed-width tiers so near-equal scores don't produce an inconsistent order ([ADR 0017](docs/adr/0017-ranking-tie-break-transitivity-fix.md)). Within a tier, `effort_label` breaks the tie — an intentional "prefer the quick win" rule, not an accident. Below that, the tied advisory's own `published_at` (newest first) and finally its `osv_id` guarantee a fully deterministic order regardless of input order or ingestion timing ([ADR 0018](docs/adr/0018-ranking-final-tie-break-published-at.md)).

Full detail: [`docs/adr/0006-scoring-algorithm.md`](docs/adr/0006-scoring-algorithm.md).

## Ecosystem support

npm (JavaScript) only, through at least Phase 5. PyPI is the planned second ecosystem — see [`docs/adr/0003-npm-ecosystem-first.md`](docs/adr/0003-npm-ecosystem-first.md) for why npm came first and how the ingestor interface stays ecosystem-agnostic for when that lands.

Dependency resolution currently reads `package.json` only — lock file parsing (`package-lock.json`/`pnpm-lock.yaml`/`yarn.lock`) is detected but not yet parsed, so resolved versions are estimated from declared ranges rather than confirmed. This is visibly flagged as lower confidence wherever it applies, never silently assumed.

`packages/core/src/db/schema.ts` is the single source of truth for every database type — see [ADR 0011](docs/adr/0011-schema-as-single-type-source.md).

## Local development

Requires Node.js ≥20 and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) ≥9 (this project pins `9.15.0`).

1. **Clone and install**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SpIob/DepTend
   cd deptend.dev
   pnpm install
   ```

   (`pnpm install` also builds `packages/core` automatically via a root `postinstall` hook — nothing else to build by hand for a first-time setup.)

2. **Set up environment variables** — copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill it in:
   - `DATABASE_URL` / `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` — from a free [Neon](https://neon.tech/) project (pooled and direct connection strings; the direct one is required for schema/migration work)
   - `GH_CLIENT_ID` / `GH_CLIENT_SECRET` — from a [GitHub OAuth App](https://github.com/settings/developers) with callback URL `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`
   - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` — generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`
   - `NEXTAUTH_URL` — `http://localhost:3000` for local dev
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN` — a personal access token (read-only, public repos) for ingestion and CLI use
   - `GH_DISPATCH_TOKEN` / `GH_REPO` — only needed to test the on-demand ingestion trigger locally; safe to leave blank otherwise

3. **Apply the database schema** (replays the existing migration history — this project uses migration files, not `drizzle-kit push`)

   ```bash
   pnpm drizzle-kit migrate
   ```

4. **Run the dashboard**

   ```bash
   pnpm --filter app dev
   ```

   Visit `http://localhost:3000`. OAuth sign-in only round-trips correctly from a stable URL matching your OAuth App's registered callback — not from arbitrary preview URLs.

5. **Run an ingestion manually** (populates real mission data without waiting for the nightly cron)

   ```bash
   node scripts/ingest.js --repo-url https://github.com/owner/name --triggered-by manual
   ```

6. **Build and try the CLI**

   ```bash
   pnpm --filter @deptend/cli build
   node cli/dist/index.js /path/to/a/local/repo --github-url https://github.com/owner/name
   ```

7. **Verify your changes** — the standard loop this project uses before every commit, run from a fully clean state:
   ```bash
   rm -rf packages/core/dist app/.next cli/dist
   pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm build && pnpm lint && pnpm format:check
   ```

## Status

Phases 0–4 complete: foundation, data pipeline, scoring engine, MVP dashboard (live), and the CLI companion. Currently entering Phase 5 (public rescue board — filterable cross-repo mission view, mission claiming). See [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) for the full decision history and the `PhaseN_Status.md` documents for phase-by-phase detail.

## Contributing

This is currently a solo-maintained project without a formal contribution process yet. Issues and discussion are welcome via the GitHub repo's issue tracker (also used as the project's task board — no external project management tool, per the project's zero-budget/solo-dev principles).

## License

Not yet finalized — treat this repo as all-rights-reserved until a license is added.
